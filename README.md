# Estimating the Hubble Parameter and Age of the Universe Using Type Ia Supernovae

This project analyzes the Pantheon+SH0ES Type Ia supernova dataset to estimate the Hubble constant \( H_0 \) and the age of the Universe \( t_0 \) within the ΛCDM cosmological model. It implements data visualization, curve fitting, and numerical integration techniques using Python.

---

# Objectives

- Construct the Hubble diagram using redshift \( z \) and distance modulus.
- Fit theoretical models (ΛCDM) to the data to extract the Hubbke constant.
- Use the fitted Hubble constant to numerically compute the age of the Universe.

# Background

Type Ia supernovae serve as **standard candles** in cosmology. By comparing observed magnitudes with redshifts, we reconstruct the universe’s expansion history and constrain cosmological parameters.

Key concepts:
- Luminosity Distance 
- Distance Modulus
- Hubble’s Law and ΛCDM dynamics

# Tools

- `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`
- Curve fitting (`scipy.optimize.curve_fit`)
- Numerical integration (`scipy.integrate.quad`)

## 🔬 Results

- Estimated Hubble constant:  H_0 =  72.97 ± 0.26 km/s/Mpc  
- Estimated age of the universe: t_0 =  12.37 billion years  
- Comparison with Planck (CMB) and SH0ES (local) values shown in final plots.
